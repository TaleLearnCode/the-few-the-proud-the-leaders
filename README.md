## Abstract

Authentic leadership isn‚Äôt about authority‚Äîit‚Äôs about inspiring, guiding, and empowering teams to excel. In the fast-paced world of software development, effective leadership is a competitive advantage, yet it‚Äôs often overlooked.

This session uncovers powerful parallels between Marine Corps leadership principles and software development. It demonstrates how 14 time-tested leadership traits‚Äîsuch as integrity, decisiveness, and dependability‚Äîcan transform how teams collaborate, innovate, and execute. Through real-world examples and interactive exercises, participants will gain actionable strategies to build trust, foster accountability, and drive team resilience.

Attendees will explore what separates a true leader from a mere manager and walk away with practical techniques to cultivate high-performing teams. Whether you're a seasoned leader or stepping into leadership for the first time, this session will equip you with foundational principles that empower teams to operate with clarity, discipline, and purpose.

Join us to discover how the ethos of the Marine Corps can elevate your leadership approach, strengthening software teams with the mindset and effectiveness of **the few, the proud, the leaders**.
